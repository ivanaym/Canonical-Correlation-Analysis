# Canonical-Correlation-Analysis

Overview
This repository contains code and data for the study of the relationship between economic and health indicators in Indonesia using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). The goal of this study is to identify which economic and health variables are most influential and to investigate the impact of economic changes on public health outcomes. This research analyzes economic indicators such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), unemployment rate, and inflation, alongside health indicators like life expectancy and infant mortality rate.

The dataset used is sourced from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) for the year 2023.

Methods
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)
CCA is a statistical technique used to analyze the relationship between two sets of variables. In this study, we explore the correlation between two groups:

Economic Variables: These include GDP, unemployment, and inflation.
Health Variables: These include life expectancy, infant mortality, and percentage of population with health complaints.
Key Features
Assumption Testing: Includes tests for multivariate normality, non-multicollinearity, and linearity.
Canonical Functions: Three canonical functions were derived from the data, each describing the relationship between economic and health variables with varying strengths.
